//        marking an available cell in a 3 * 3 grid with their respective tokens
//        (either X or O). When one player has placed three tokens in a horizontal, vertical, or
//        diagonal row on the grid, the game is over and that player has won. A draw (no
//        winner) occurs when all the cells on the grid have been filled with tokens and
//        neither player has achieved a win. Create a program for playing tic-tac-toe.
//         The program prompts two players to enter an X token and O token alternately.
//         Whenever a token is entered, the program redisplays the board on the
//        console and determines the status of the game (win, draw, or continue).
